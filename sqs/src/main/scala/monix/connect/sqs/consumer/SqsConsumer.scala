    *                     - Standard: it will solely represent the number of messages requested and

    *                     is a deletion or the `visibilityTimeout` gets expired.
    *                     See the official aws docs for further details.

    *                          the call returns sooner than the wait timeout.
    *                          By default, `waitTimeSeconds` is set to [[Duration.Zero]], aka `short pooling`,
    *                          which means that it will only consume messages available at that time.
    *                          On the other hand, the user can switch to `long pooling` by increasing the
    *                          `waitTimeSeconds` to more than zero, which in that case it will wait for

    *                          Notice that in `short polling` (default), if there is no available message
    *                          because the `inFlight` has reached the maximum limits of the queue it will
    *                          return [[software.amazon.awssdk.services.sqs.model.OverLimitException]],
    *                          on the other hand, when using long pooling we would just not receive messages.
